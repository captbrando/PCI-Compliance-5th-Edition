## What This Book is About
If you are like most information technology and information security professionals, the idea of becoming compliant with PCI DSS or countless other regulations doesn't sound fun. It's much more common to associate compliance efforts with pain. Whether it's the pain of not knowing what to do, pain of failing your first assessment, or pain of complying without any budget, there are plenty of challenges for anyone tasked with doing this well.

We faced a challenge, to write a fun, useful, and insightful book about PCI DSS. We are committed to the challenge! We’d like to invite you, our reader, to travel with us in the hopes that when you turn the last page, you would come to realize that PCI DSS compliance can indeed be fun!

## How to Use the Book in Your Daily Job
